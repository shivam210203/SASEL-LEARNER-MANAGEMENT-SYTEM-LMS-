        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> This course will provide students with an overview of Engineering Physics concepts and technologies. It is meant as a primer for non-majors, i.e., for students who donâ€™t have networking as a core course in their curriculum. After this primer, students may choose to take other networking courses for delving deeper into specific technologies.</p>
        <p>
            The course is free to enroll and learn from. But if you want a certificate, you have to register and write the proctored exam conducted by us in person at any of the designated exam centres.
            The exam is optional for a fee of Rs 1000/- (Rupees one thousand only).<br>
            Date and Time of Exams: 24 September 2023 Morning session 9am to 12 noon; Afternoon Session 2pm to 5pm.<br>
            Registration url: Announcements will be made when the registration form is open for registrations.<br>
            The online registration form has to be filled and the certification exam fee needs to be paid. More details will be made available when the exam registration form is published. If there are any changes, it will be mentioned then.<br>
            Please check the form for more details on the cities where the exams will be held, the conditions you agree to when you fill the form etc.<p>
            The field of Science plays a vital role in today's business landscape. With the exponential growth of data, businesses rely on advanced
            Big Data Analytics, statistical analysis, data extraction, manipulation, visualization, and data maintenance to identify trends, interpret
            results, and predict future outcomes.Our curriculum prepares students to be at the forefront of this data-driven revolution, empowering them to excel in the industry.</p>     
            
        <h2>Course Instructors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mr. Sanjiv Badhe, is presently working as Asst. Professor in Physics in K. J. Somaiya Institute of Engineering and Information Technology. He completed his graduation and Post graduation in Physics from University of Mumbai with first class. He has been teaching Physics for 20 years at an undergraduate level. 
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Course Outcomes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Remembering:</b> Start by identifying and clearly understanding the Physics problem you need to solve. This involves recalling the problem statement, objectives, and any relevant background information.</li>
          
            <li><b>Comprehension:</b> Classify the Physics problem into a standard typology. This means categorizing it into common problem types like classification, regression, clustering, or recommendation, depending on the nature of the problem.</li>
          
            <li><b>Application:</b> Develop R code for Physics solutions. This step involves writing and implementing the code to preprocess data, build models, and carry out data analysis using the R programming language.</li>
          
            <li><b>Analysis:</b> Correlate the results obtained from the R code to the solution approach followed. Examine the outputs, model performance metrics, and insights generated from the data analysis to assess their alignment with the problem-solving strategy.</li>
          
            <li><b>Evaluation:</b> Assess the solution approach's effectiveness. Evaluate the performance of the data science solution by using appropriate evaluation metrics and criteria, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), depending on the problem type.</li>
          
            <li><b>Creating:</b> Construct use cases to validate the approach and identify modifications required. Create practical scenarios or case studies that test the solution in real-world situations. These use cases help in further refining the approach and making any necessary adjustments.</li>
          </ol>
